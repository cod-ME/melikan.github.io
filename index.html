  <strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source"> Open-source software</a></strong> is a type of computer software whose source code is freely available to everyone, licensed without restrictions on usage, modification, or distribution. The copyright holders allow users not only to use the software but also to improve it—by adding new features, enhancing existing ones, or fixing bugs. For this reason, open-source software is often developed collaboratively by communities rather than individuals or companies alone.

<p class="opensource-benefits">
  <strong>Benefits of an Opensource software:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>It strengthens our programming knowledge and helps us learn new skills.</li>
    <li>We don’t need to build everything from scratch; we can fork existing projects and experiment with them.</li>
    <li>Contributions to open-source projects provide immediate feedback on our work.</li>
    <li>Open-source collaboration connects us with like-minded developers worldwide, fostering networks and shared learning.</li>
  </ul>

  <strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux"> GNU/Linux</a></strong> is an open-source operating system that combines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU"><strong>the GNU tools</strong></a> and utilities with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel"><strong>the Linux kernel</strong></a>. Unlike proprietary operating systems, its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This openness allows users to customize their system, improve security, and adapt it for specific needs, making it highly flexible and community-driven. 
</p>

<p class="linux-benefits"><strong>Benefits of GNU/Linux:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>It gives complete control over your system and how it operates.</li>
    <li>It encourages learning and understanding of computing at a deeper level.</li>
    <li>Users can choose from a wide variety of distributions tailored to different purposes, from desktops to servers.</li>
    <li>Strong community support enables collaboration, troubleshooting, and sharing of knowledge globally.</li>

    <p>on OpenSource and GNU/Linux</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>I choose the open-source model because it represents a philosophy of transparency, collaboration, and personal freedom. Open-source software gives me full control over the tools I use, allowing me to understand, modify, and improve them without hidden restrictions. In an age where government censorship and corporate surveillance threaten digital autonomy, open-source stands as a practical defense of technological freedom. It ensures that knowledge remains accessible, that systems can be trusted because their code is open, and that individuals—not institutions—retain the power to shape their digital environments. For me, open-source is not just software; it is a commitment to openness, independence, and the belief that technology should empower people rather than limit them.
